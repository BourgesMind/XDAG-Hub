XDAG Hub Privacy Policy
=============================

Last Updated: September 18, 2023
--------------------------------

XDag Ecosystem(collectively called “xdag”, “we,” “us,” and “our”) provide users with an interface which facilitates our interaction with the Protocol, allowing for activities such as the creation of NFTs, Blockchain games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, and wallets. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how XDag ecosystem collects, uses, and shares your personal information and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.

SCOPE

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by XDag ecosystem, including on our chrome extension and websites (the “Site”), and other online and offline offerings.
